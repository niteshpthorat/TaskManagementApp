# Task Management App

This Task Management App is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks with features for adding, editing, deleting, and highlighting tasks based on their due dates.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with descriptions, due dates, and categories.
- **Edit Tasks**: Existing tasks can be modified.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
- **Task Highlighting**: Tasks due today or overdue are highlighted with different colors.
- **Notifications**: Browser notifications remind users of tasks due within the next 24 hours.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/))

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-app.git
   cd task-management-app
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
